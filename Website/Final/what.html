        <h1>What is Frank Filt</h1>
        <p>Frank filt is an entertainer. He writes, produces, and performs his own music. At every show he brings up a fan to sing along with him. Before music he had a webshow that pushed the limits when it came to creative freedom. The webshow is no longer up but the music is. Frank Filt is a depressing artist that turns some of the darkest thoughts into beautiful ballads, ranging from losing love to losing your lunch at a halloween party. </p>
