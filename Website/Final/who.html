        <h1>Who Is Frank Filt?</h1>
        <p>Frank Filt is a guy, like you and me but also not like you and me. He's always had a pretty creative mind but when he had to decide whether he would go to college or not, his parents chose for him. In school he studied accounting but as a passion project Frank Filt created a webshow that was all his. He garnered a couple million fans who enjoyed his projects. Finally he decided to drop out a year before receiving his degree in order to pursue his most desired career path, music. It has been 3 years since he gave up his webshow and began producing music but it has definitely been a beneficial move for him. The 25 year old now travels city to city to play his sad songs along with all who share his passion.</p>
