            <h2>Hellow I'm Mick and these are my nuggets. I have been a farmer since my early 20's and in the last couple of years I have found a new passion. One day while tending to my chickens on the farm, my 4 year old grandson came over crying asking if the chickens were going to become chicken nuggets. At first  I just thought it was funny and laughed, but a short while after I thought about it again and again. I have been raising chickens and selling them at reasonable prices for years, how about I try something new. I took a quarter of the chickens I sell and made chicken nuggets for my family. My family loved them! And so the following weeks I made more and decided to invite neighboring folks over to try them, and hot dog they loved them as well. With the help of my family I was able to start up a small shop in the big city and with the help of my family we will continue to expand. So come on over and join the family. </h2>
